COMP 3005 Assignment 3 - Part 1

Program description: 
This program has two classes, "Main.java" and "dbms.java", as well as a "pom.xml" file. 
- The dbms class contains the function definitions for the assignment's requirements, as well as the code to create a connection to my own postgres server.
- The Main class contains code that creates an instance of the dbms class, which establishes a connection to postgres, and allows for user I/O through an options menu to use the functions in dbms.
- The pom.xml file is used to add connectivity to postgres through Maven

Compilation and running:

- Create the database in postgres following the video I made and the assignment instructions.
- Copy this code into your own IDE (IntelliJ IDEA).
- Ensure that you change the url, user, and password variables in the dbms.java file to your own settings for your own personal database you are using
- Click Run in the IDE, the IDE will automatically compile and run the program.
